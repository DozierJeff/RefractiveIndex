# RefractiveIndex
For ice, the code uses the data from Warren & Brandt (2008) complementing from 320 to 600 nm with data from Picard et al. (2016). Available options include retrieving the Warren-Brandt data without the Picard supplement, or using the Warren (1984) data instead.
For water, the code uses data from Hale and Query (1973).
For dust, the code currently uses measurements from Skiles et al. (2017) based on measurements from dust from the Colorado Plateau, supplemented with measurements from Charlie Zender's website http://dust.ess.uci.edu/smn/smn_cgd_200610.pdf. Information based on dust from other regions will be added.
For soot, the data from Bond & Bergstrom (2006) are used.
